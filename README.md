## 🧰 Languages & Technologies Used

Across the various projects, the repository includes code in:

- Python (for ML / data tasks)
- PHP (for backend / web apps)
- JavaScript (for front-end / web apps)
- HTML / CSS (for website front-end)
- Jupyter Notebook (for data / ML experiments)

## 🚀 Purpose & Why This Repo

The main goal of this repository is to keep a record of different exercises, demos, and projects I’ve worked on during college — from small scripts to full web apps — so I can revisit them, build on them, or showcase them as examples of my work and learning path.
